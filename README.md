🚀 How to Run the Seismic Token Contract Deployment and Airdrop Script
Welcome to the Seismic Token Contract Deployment and Airdrop project! This guide will walk you through the steps to run the code, deploy a Seismic token contract, and execute a token airdrop.

Prerequisites 📋
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

Node.js: Install Node.js (LTS version is recommended).

Git: You need Git to clone the repository and interact with your version control.

Private Keys: You'll need to have access to Ethereum private keys for the deployment.

Step 1: Clone the Repository 🔥
To start, clone the project repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/centaur9875/Seismic-Juswa-Bot.git
cd Seismic-Juswa-Bot
Step 2: Install Dependencies 🧩
Run the following command to install the required packages and dependencies.

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
This will install the following packages:

ethers: Ethereum library for interacting with contracts.

fs: File system module for saving contract files.

solc: Solidity compiler.

dotenv: To load environment variables from .env file.

readline: For reading input from the command line.

crypto: For generating secure random data.

Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables 🔑
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your private keys. This file will store sensitive information such as private keys used to deploy the contract.

Example .env file:

ini
Copy
Edit
PRIVATE_KEYS="0xYourPrivateKey1,0xYourPrivateKey2"
Each private key should be separated by a comma and without spaces.

Step 4: Prepare the Contract Source 📜
The script will deploy a Seismic Token contract. This contract is written in Solidity. By default, the contract source is included in the script. However, you can modify it as needed.

Step 5: Run the Deployment Script 🏗️
Once everything is set up, execute the deployment script with the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
node deploy.js
During the process, you’ll be prompted to enter details for the token deployment:

Token Name: Choose a name for your token (e.g., Seismic).

Token Symbol: Choose a symbol (e.g., SEISM).

Total Supply: Enter the total supply of tokens to be created.

Step 6: Transfer Tokens (Optional) 💸
After the contract is deployed, you will have the option to transfer tokens to other addresses. If you choose to do so:

Number of Transfers: Define how many transfers you'd like to make.

Amount Per Transfer: Specify the amount of tokens per transfer.

The script will automatically generate random addresses and send tokens to them.

Step 7: Monitor the Process 🖥️
Throughout the deployment and transfer process, you’ll see logs in your terminal with information about:

The wallet addresses being used for deployment.

Transaction hashes and status updates.

Any errors encountered during the process.

Step 8: Verify on the Blockchain 📡
After the deployment and transfer process is completed, you can verify the contract and transactions on the blockchain. Use your favorite block explorer (e.g., Etherscan) to check the contract address and transaction details.

Troubleshooting 🛠️
If you encounter any issues, check the following:

Private Keys: Ensure you have provided valid Ethereum private keys in the .env file.

ETH Balance: Ensure the wallet has enough ETH for gas fees to deploy and transfer tokens.

Solidity Compilation Errors: If the contract has issues compiling, the script will provide specific error messages to help debug.

Additional Information 📚
Seismic Network: The token is deployed on the Seismic devnet (Chain ID: 5124). Ensure that you are connected to the correct network if you are using a local or different blockchain.

Security: Never share your private keys publicly. Use environment variables to store sensitive data securely.

🌟 Final Words
Congrats on deploying your token contract and completing the airdrop! 🎉 We hope this project helps you get started with blockchain development and token deployment.
